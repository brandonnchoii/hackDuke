<blockquote>
  <p>ChalkTalk provides an avenue for new Teachers for America volunteers to reach out to the communities they will be working in and for community members and other teachers to contribute. Here, volunteers can look at current education events of the places they will be living and teaching in, and educators can give feedback to each other. Our goal is that teachers will better acclimate to their working environment.</p>
